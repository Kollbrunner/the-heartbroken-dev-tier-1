<h2>A little backstory 
</h2>
<P>

  I quit school when i was 19.
  About a week after that i started working at a construction site as a "traditional apprentice" meaning i knew absolutely jack shit when it comes to building anything.
  I hated it in the beginning, i was humiliated, punished with tasks nobody else wanted to do and almost died a few times from said tasks.
  BUT, i didnt give up because i knew it would get better with time if i just kept on grinding, and trying to improve.
  I was right and 2 years into the job i became the highest paid apprentice in my country.
  <p>Now, 10 years in, im the best in what is the most lucrative part of the construction process (floor leveling)but im not satisfied yet.</p>



<p>Which brings me to you Mr Heartbroken Dev.</p>
                        

<p>There is no more ladder for me to climb in my current job,but i want to keep on climbing,and i believe you have the next challenge in store for me.
